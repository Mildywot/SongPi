# Song Recognition with Blurred Background

This project sets up a Python environment for recognizing songs using Shazamio, displaying album art with a blurred background, and dynamically adjusting text color based on background brightness. The project uses Tkinter for the GUI and PyAudio for recording audio.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Extract the 7zip file (normal zip file wouldn't go smaller than 25MB for GitHub)

### 2. Double click the 'SongPi.exe' file to run



##Tips:

- Press Esc button to toggle between full screen and windowed mode, feel free to resize to whatever you want.
- Make sure your PC has a microphone.


Cheers.
