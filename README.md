# Song Recognition with Blurred Background

This project sets up a Python environment for recognizing songs using Shazamio, displaying album art with a blurred background, and dynamically adjusting text color based on background brightness. The project uses Tkinter for the GUI and PyAudio for recording audio.

The following versions are available: 
- Raspberry Pi
- Windows (easy as: zip package that is already set up, just click the .exe to run)
- Windows (less easy: installs a virtual Python environment and uses a script to run SongPi)

## Raspberry Pi
### 1. Install Python 

 

## Less easy Windows mode setup instructions

### 1. Install Python

Install Python by running 'python-3.12.3.exe', or from the Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/

***Make sure that you select the 'add python.exe to PATH' option during the install.***


### 2. Run the Setup Script

Double click '1st time setup.bat' and let the script run until it finishes, if you get an error then try run it again I reckon.

***Once you've done the above setup the first time, you can just click the Start.bat file next time you want to run the program***


### 3. Run the script

Double click the 'Start.bat' file, it loads a virtual Python environment and runs the SongPi code for you.



## Tips:

- Press Esc button to toggle between full screen and windowed mode, feel free to resize to whatever you want.
- Make sure your PC has a microphone (USB and built-in mics work well I think, haven't test much else)
- Enjoy?!

Cheers.
